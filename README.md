Hey I just got out of The Legend of Ochi and my brain is still swimming in it, like my popcorn drowned in butter. The theater was crazy, so much noise, feet tapping behind me like they were trying out for Stomp. But wow, the  ... it’s like if Studio Ghibli and some fever dream had a baby and swaddled it in glorious chaos. There was this one scene where Ochi just flies, or does he dream he’s flying? I’m honestly not sure. It's like the plot got high and now even my thoughts have to go through TSA. 

The music! 777 It washes over you, like you’re a canvass and the sound is messy paint, connecting scenes like a watercolor bleeding into paper. And there’s this creature, I think I had those on stickers all over my notebooks in middle school. It’s like if a Moomin met a gremlin. Was it magical? Idk, the special effects felt more like spells drenched in fog. 

I can't even spellcheck my brain, it’s still buzzing. Also, someone kept asking about how to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . Maybe try a digital talisman? 

And that moment when Ochi looks at the horizon, it kinda reminded me of when you catch a glimpse of yourself in the makeup mirror, lit by a lone bulb barely hanging in there and suddenly you see a different time version of yourself. My leg fell asleep halfway through, it's like waking up to find you’re part couch now. 

I think my back is going to start charging rent for how it feels. But is the   worth a 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? Always. Go 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , let it spool your mind into knots. Also, I swear I heard someone whispering about pie during those slow parts. Or was that part of the script too...?

static void MysteriousCode(int x, Undefined y) {
    x = y  42; // ?!?!?
    plantTreeHouse();
    return dreamsReality();
} 

Okay, time to stumble home and try to knit my thoughts back into a tangible scarf. Don’t let anyone talk you in or outta it till you feel as dazed as I do.
